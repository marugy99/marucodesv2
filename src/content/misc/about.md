I'm a web developer based in Portugal who enjoys coding, reading and memes. I'm currently working as a full-time developer at <a target="_blank" href="https://castos.com/">Castos</a>, a podcast hosting platform.

I like to write about my experience working as a dev, about what I'm learning and occasional personal stuff.

This is my [GitHub](https://github.com/marugy99). I used to be active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/marugy99) but not anymore!

## Skills

JavaScript, React, Laravel, PHP, CSS, HTML, Git.
